# DIGITAL-SYSTEM-DESIGN
This repository contains some codes in Verilog. 
<br>
Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL) used to model electronic systems. It's commonly used in digital circuit design.
<br>
All the codes which are present are done in behaviour modelling.
<br>
The problem given for a code is mentioned in the "Extended description" for each design and testbench file accordingly.
